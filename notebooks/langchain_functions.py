LangChain Multi-Agent System
==============================================================

This file implements a multi-agent AI research system using LangChain framework.
LangChain is a framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs).

LANGCHAIN VS CREWAI DIFFERENCES:
- CrewAI: Purpose-built for agent collaboration with built-in workflows
- LangChain: General-purpose LLM framework, requires custom agent implementation
- This implementation: Custom agents that match CrewAI's behavior exactly

FRAMEWORK STANDARDIZATION:
To ensure fair comparison across frameworks, this LangChain implementation uses:
- Identical agent roles and expertise as CrewAI baseline
- Identical prompts and task descriptions
- Identical sequential workflow with context passing
- Identical output structure and metrics

WHY STANDARDIZE?
Without standardization, performance differences could be due to:
- Different prompts or agent roles
- Different workflows or context passing
- Different output formats
By standardizing, we ensure performance differences reflect framework architecture only.

LANGCHAIN MULTI-AGENT APPROACH:
1. Custom Agent class that mimics CrewAI Agent behavior
2. Manual workflow orchestration (vs CrewAI's built-in Process)
3. Manual context passing between agents
4. Compatible result format for fair comparison

    Custom Agent class that replicates CrewAI Agent functionality.
    
    WHAT THIS CLASS DOES:
    Since LangChain doesn't have built-in collaborative agents like CrewAI,
    we create our own Agent class that:
    - Stores agent role, goal, and expertise (like CrewAI)
    - Executes tasks using the same prompt structure
    - Tracks performance and memory
    - Returns compatible results
    
    WHY CUSTOM CLASS?
    LangChain is a general framework - it provides LLM interfaces but doesn't
    have CrewAI's specialized agent collaboration features. This custom class
    bridges that gap for fair comparison.
