## 🏆 Why This Matters

### Fair Comparison Problem
Traditional AI framework comparisons often use different prompts, agents, or workflows, making it impossible to determine if performance differences are due to framework architecture or implementation differences.

### Our Solution
By standardizing every aspect of the multi-agent workflow while preserving each framework's unique architecture, this system enables true "apples-to-apples" comparison of framework capabilities and performance.

### Professional Development Environment
The Docker-based setup eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and provides a consistent, reproducible environment for AI development and research.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### GPU Configuration
The system is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs but works on CPU-only systems:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml - GPU enabled (default)
deploy:
  resources:
    reservations:
      devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: all
          capabilities: [gpu]

# For CPU-only systems, comment out the deploy section
```

### Resource Management
- **Memory**: Ollama requires 4-8GB RAM depending on model size
- **Storage**: Models require 4-7GB disk space
- **CPU**: Multi-threading support for parallel analysis
- **Network**: Internal Docker network for optimal service communication
